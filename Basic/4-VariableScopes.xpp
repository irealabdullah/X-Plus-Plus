/*What is variable scopes?
â€¢ A scope defines the area in which an item can be accessed
1. Instance variables declared in class declarations can be accessed from any method in the class and from methods
that extend(inherit) the class
2. local variables can be accessed only in the block in which they were defined all variables created by users
have local scope
